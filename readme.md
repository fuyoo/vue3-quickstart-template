## easy mock an api just need following two steps

1. create an api.js file at the mock directory.
2. write some node.js script in the api.js.
   ```javascript
   module.exports = {
        method: 'get',
        path: '/home/:id',// request http://url/home/id?q=1 by get method
        handler: async ({ params, query, body, headers }) => {
            return process.response.ok({
                params,
                query,
                body,
                headers
            })
        }
   }
    ```

> when the process started.
> process will watch the mock directory auto generate api route if the directory has been changed
> so if your write complete, api has been auto generated!
> more example please look `mock` directory

## response format function

> there have three functions mounted at the global process object.

* first is `ok` `process.response.ok(data,headers)` .
* second is `fail` `process.response.fail(code,msg,headers)` .
* third is `format` `process.response.format(code,data,msg,headers)`.
